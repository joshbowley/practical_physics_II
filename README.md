# Practical Physics — University of Exeter

This repository contains my Python-based data analysis and visualisation work from my Practical Physics modules at the University of Exeter. Each Jupyter Notebook explores a different experiment or dataset, applying quantitative analysis, regression methods and uncertainty calculations in a clear and reproducible way.

Contents

- Experiment_1_...ipynb — Atomic Spectroscopy and Duane's Law
- (more to be added as the course progresses)

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- uncertainties (for propagation of experimental error)

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and numerical analysis in Python
- Linear and non-linear regression
- Error analysis and uncertainty propagation
- Data visualisation and clear presentation of results
- Reproducible scientific computation

## Notes

These notebooks were produced as part of undergraduate laboratory work. Each one focuses on using Python to analyse experimental data in a structured and transparent way, similar to workflows used in research, engineering and data analysis roles.
