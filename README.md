# Practical Physics II

This repository contains analysis for my second-year physics laboratory modules. The work is implemented in Jupyter notebooks with a focus on reproducibility, clear documentation, and rigorous uncertainty analysis.

Experiments analysed include spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and optical/diffraction measurements, depending on the practical.

## Features
- Full data-processing pipelines in Python
- Uncertainty propagation and error analysis
- Weighted linear regression and model fitting
- Structured notebooks with clear markdown explanations
- Plotting and visualisation for laboratory reports
- Importable helper functions for consistent workflows

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter

## Skills Demonstrated
- Scientific data analysis
